base = 10

# Create a variable named height and set it equal to 5.0
height = 5.0
area = 0.5*base*height
# Create an "area" variable and set it equal to the expression "0.5 * base * height".
# This will calculate the area of a triangle.  Then print the area to the screen.
print(area)
print(type(area))



# Use the type() and print() functions to print the type of the "area" variable
